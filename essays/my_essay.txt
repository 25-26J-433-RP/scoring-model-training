Dear Local Newspaper,  

In today’s world, computers play an important role in almost every aspect of our lives.  
I believe computers have a positive effect on people because they help us learn new information, allow us to connect with others, and keep us safe by giving us productive ways to spend our time.  

First, computers are powerful learning tools. With just one click, students can search for facts, read articles, and watch videos about any topic. For example, if a student is writing a report about the solar system, the internet provides pictures, explanations, and even animations that make learning much easier than only using a textbook. This easy access to knowledge motivates students to study and stay interested in school.  

Second, computers make communication faster and more meaningful. Families who live in different states or countries can see each other using webcams or talk instantly through email and social media. In the past, people had to wait for letters to arrive, but today a simple video call can bring families together even when they are far apart. Computers also help friends share ideas and stay connected, which improves relationships.  

Finally, computers give young people safe and constructive options for spending their time. Instead of being pressured into negative activities, kids can play games, join educational websites, or chat responsibly with friends. Parents know their children are at home, learning and having fun, rather than getting into trouble outside.  

In conclusion, computers improve education, communication, and safety. While it is true that people should not spend every hour on a screen, when used wisely, computers have a strong and positive effect on society. They help us grow smarter, bring families closer together, and keep communities safer. That is why I believe computers benefit our lives.  

Sincerely,  
A Concerned Student
